This repository contains a notebook for a Topic Classification Workshop. The notebook demonstrates the creation of a robust topic classification model using machine learning techniques. It covers data collection, preprocessing, tokenization, model training, and evaluation using F1-score. The dataset consists of various topics such as Medical, Finance, Sports, Politics, Culture, Tech, and Religion. It includes instructions for data processing, model training preparation, and model evaluation. The code showcases the use of BERT tokenizer and provides a comprehensive approach to text classification. For model evaluation, the F1-score metric is utilized
